Task 3: Database Migration - Summary Report
============================================

Objective:
----------
To migrate the 'Sales' table from a MySQL database to a PostgreSQL database,
ensuring the data is transferred accurately and fully.

Steps Followed:
---------------
1. Created the 'Sales' table in MySQL with 6 customer records.
2. Exported the data from MySQL as a .csv file using MySQL Workbench.
3. In PostgreSQL (pgAdmin), created the same table structure.
4. Faced technical issues while importing CSV into pgAdmin.
5. As an alternative, inserted the data manually using SQL INSERT statements.
6. Verified data using SELECT queries and confirmed 6 rows were successfully migrated.

Tools Used:
-----------
- MySQL Workbench (for data creation and export)
- pgAdmin (for PostgreSQL data insertion)
- Manual SQL for verification

Result:
-------
Migration was successfully completed. Data integrity was maintained by using the same
data set in both databases and checking row counts and content.
